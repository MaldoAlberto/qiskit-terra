Setting transpiler optimization level
#####################################

This guide shows you how to use the ``optimization_level``
parameter with :func:`~qiskit.compiler.transpile`.

``optimization_level`` helps you to optimize your quantum circuit.
This parameter takes an integer which can be a value between 0 and 3,
where the higher the number, the more optimized the result.
You can find more information about this parameter's value and its meaning for
the internals of the :mod:`~.transpiler` in: :ref:`working_with_preset_pass_managers`.

Initialize the quantum circuit
==============================

The effect of setting the ``optimization_level`` will differ depending on the backend you are using.
For this example, you will explore the `CSWAP <https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.cswap.html>`_ gate,
which is a three qubit gate which will be transpiled into one and two qubit gates.

    :include-source:

    from qiskit import QuantumCircuit 
    from qiskit.compiler import transpile
    from qiskit.providers.fake_provider import FakeQuito

    backend = FakeQuito()

    qc = QuantumCircuit(3) # Initialize the quantum circuit with 3 qubits.
    
    qc.cswap(0,1,2) # Add the cswap gate to the quantum circuit.
    
    qc.draw("mpl")


Using backendâ€™s information
===========================


You should adhere to the specific configuration of your backend when utilizing :meth:`~qiskit.transpile` . 
This process entails breaking down your circuit into :attr:`~qiskit.transpile.basis_gates` and considering the physical connections specified in the 
:attr:`~qiskit.transpile.coupling_map` for two qubit gates.
Given the presence of noise in the backend, it is crucial to optimize your circuit by adjusting the ``optimization_level`` parameter. 
This will help minimize the number of circuit operations and enhance the overall performance.

What each optimization level does
---------------------------------


When using a backend, you can access its properties through the instruction  :meth:`backend.configuration()`.
These properties, such as basis gates, coupling map, and init layout, play a crucial role in shaping the behavior of the quantum circuit.

For example, with :meth:`~qiskit.providers.fake_provider.FakeQuito`, you can learn about its qubit connections and the gates it uses to generate your quantum circuits.

.. testcode::

    print(f"Basis gates of your backend: {backend.configuration().basis_gates}")
    print(f"Coupling map of your backend: ",{backend.configuration().coupling_map}")

.. testoutput::

    Basis gates of your backend:  ['id', 'rz', 'sx', 'x', 'cx', 'reset']
    Coupling map of your backend:  [[0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 1], [3, 1], [3, 4], [4, 3]]

When setting the ``optimization_level`` to 0, the resulting quantum circuit is not optimized and simply mapped to the device, considering a trivial layout and stochastic swap. 
The coupling map, represented by the subset ``[[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1]]``, indicates the physical qubits available in the backend. 
In this configuration, the quantum circuit is transformed into a combination of one and two-qubit gates,
represented by the ``['id', 'rz', 'sx', 'x', 'cx', 'reset']``.

.. testcode::

    qc_b0 = transpile(qc,backend=backend,optimization_level=0)
    qc_b0.draw("mpl")                          

.. plot::

    from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister 
    from qiskit.compiler import transpile
    from qiskit.providers.fake_provider import FakeQuito

    backend = FakeQuito()

    qc = QuantumCircuit(3) # Initialize the quantum circuit with 3 qubits.
    
    qc.cswap(0,1,2) # Add the cswap gate to the quantum circuit.

    qc_b0 = transpile(qc,backend=backend,optimization_level=0)
    qc_b0.draw("mpl")                          

When you set the ``optimization_level`` to 1,the circuit undergoes a light optimization process that focuses on collapsing adjacent gates 
with the goal to find a heuristic layout and swap insertion algorithm, 
improving the overall performance of the circuit. This results in a reduction in :class:`.CXGate` count and changes in the positions of qubits, 
following the connections ``[[0,1],[1,0],[2,1]]``. In this example, the two adjacent gates :math:`RZ(\pi/4)` and :math:`RZ(\pi/2)` are replaced with a single :math:`RZ(3\pi/4)` operation. 

.. note::
    This optimization level is the default setting.

.. testcode::

    qc_b1 = transpile(qc,backend=backend,optimization_level=1)
    qc_b1.draw("mpl")                                              

.. plot::

    from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister 
    from qiskit.compiler import transpile
    from qiskit.providers.fake_provider import FakeQuito

    backend = FakeQuito()

    qc = QuantumCircuit(3) # Initialize the quantum circuit with 3 qubits.
    
    qc.cswap(0,1,2) # Add the cswap gate to the quantum circuit.

    qc_b1 = transpile(qc,backend=backend,optimization_level=1)
    qc_b1.draw("mpl")                                              


When you set the :attr:`~qiskit.transpile.optimization_level`` to 2, the circuit undergoes a medium optimization process. 
This involves using a noise-adaptive layout and gate cancellation techniques based on commutation relationships similar than 1 with multiple trials. 
Depending on the circuit, this level of optimization can occasionally yield the same results as light optimization.


.. testcode::

    qc_b2 = transpile(qc,backend=backend,optimization_level=2)
    qc_b2.draw("mpl")                                                   


.. plot::

    from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister 
    from qiskit.compiler import transpile
    from qiskit.providers.fake_provider import FakeQuito

    backend = FakeQuito()

    qc = QuantumCircuit(3) # Initialize the quantum circuit with 3 qubits.
    
    qc.cswap(0,1,2) # Add the cswap gate to the quantum circuit.

    qc_b2 = transpile(qc,backend=backend,optimization_level=2)
    qc_b2.draw("mpl")                                                   

When you set the :attr:`~qiskit.transpile.optimization_level`` to 3, it enables heavy optimization. 
This level of optimization considers previous considerations and involves the resynthesis of two qubit blocks of gates in the circuit. 
The result of multiple seeds for different trials is a reduction in the number of quantum gates and the determination of the a coupling map connection, such as **[[0,1],[1,0],[2,1]]**.
Based on the basis gates, results in one less :class:`.CXGate` and the addition of eight one qubit gates.

.. testcode::

    qc_b3 = transpile(qc,backend=backend,optimization_level=3)
    qc_b3.draw("mpl")                                


.. plot::

    from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister 
    from qiskit.compiler import transpile
    from qiskit.providers.fake_provider import FakeQuito

    backend = FakeQuito()

    qc = QuantumCircuit(3) # Initialize the quantum circuit with 3 qubits.
    
    qc.cswap(0,1,2) # Add the cswap gate to the quantum circuit.

    qc_b3 = transpile(qc,backend=backend,optimization_level=3)
    qc_b3.draw("mpl")                                


Plotting the Results
====================

You can visualize the results of your previous examples by generating a plot that show the depth, number of gates, and number of CX gates of your quantum circuits. 
Now, here's something important to keep in mind. When you set the ``optimization_level`` to 3, even if the number of gates used increases, 
it's mostly because of the addition of one qubit gates. At the same time, you'll notice that the number of two-qubit gates (:class:`.CXGate` gates) 
is actually reduced compared to other optimization levels.
